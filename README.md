A blazingly simple, MacOS native menu app that tracks your todo items.
No fluff, no analytics, no cloud accounts -- nada. Built in native SwiftUI for
blazingly fast, native performance.

Track your todo items quickly from the menu bar, re-arrage to your preference,
and log due dates if needed.

Don't want other's snooping on your todo? Blur your list while you continue adding
to it!
